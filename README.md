# Simon Game Challenge

This is a Simon Game that I create for a Web Development Bootcamp where I learned about HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Just open index.html on your web browser for inicialize the game.

Then watch the animation of the color squares, remember the order of the animations and repeat the pattern by clicking on each color.

Accumulate as many levels as you can! Game will over when you make a mistake.
